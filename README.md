# Collision-Detection-Thesis
MATLAB + Simulink and Python scripts for my Bachelor's Thesis on Control Design for Collision Detection.

The MATLAB Model folder holds the scripts/Simulink models to run the robotic arm. The Dataset Creator script allows to gather a chunky dataset of collision/non-collision events, edits it and sends off as a .csv

The Python code has the 'manual' script, which helped me to understand what are binary Logistic Regression Classifiers. The 'sklearn' script is the code I used to make predictions for the final thesis report.

The dataset 'LRC_dataset_016_Feature_Engineering' is available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cPX_ZLiPdq9ZTqz0rapsQ7imjBsPArRS
